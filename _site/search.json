I completed my bachelor’s and post-bachelor’s degree in Biology, with specializations in Tropical Biology and Natural Resource Management, at Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.\n\n\nFor my research, I enjoy using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) to explore the evolutionary and ecological aspects of bats, taking advantage of their diversity in ecological interactions and their variation in morphological and physiological traits. Additionally, I like to incorporate spatial and environmental data to provide a geographic perspective in my work. I am also passionate about seeking conservation implications for bats and the ecosystems they inhabit.\n\n\nIn La Selva (OET, Costa Rica. 2021), I had the opportunity to catch and handle a Vampyrum spectrum (Family Phyllostomidae), the largest bat in America.\n\n\nCurrently, I am a master’s student of Biology at Towson University in Maryland (since fall 2023). I am a member of the Caetano Lab. My project will focus on topics related to diet and bat macroevolution.\n\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy cycling, running, and painting. I also love to go hiking in the mountains and coffee plantations close to my home. I have a dog named Ema, and I enjoy taking her for hiking or short walks at night (when I am in home, but unfortunately she is not with me right now).\n\n\nDuring one of my bike trips in Costa Rica, I reached the entrance of the Barva Volcano sector (2900 m.a.s.l) within Braulio Carrillo National Park.\n\n\n\n\n",

These thoughts made me study biology and focus on ecology and evolution, using bats as models, especially their trophic interaction and how that is related to their evolution and diversification. As a scientist, I know that the quality and quantity of publications are essential to growing in academia. However, I also know that the experiences one has through learning, research, or any other academic activity (e.g., conferences) and the people one meets make a difference if I seek to improve both as a scientist and as a person. Also, some of those experiences are much more fun than the publication process. So, why not remember and document them?!!\n\n\nPD: Some of the posts are/will be in Spanish. No problem, if you are still interested just use the translator as I usually do.\n\n\nPost # 1 - July 2024\n\n\nThis is my first post and hopefully not the last one.\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n#\n\n\n\n\n",

A project with a meta-analysis approach. (2018-2020)\n\n\nThe loss of tropical forest cover caused by land-use change is causing changes in populations of animal trophic guilds, including those belonging to Phyllostomidae bat species. They fulfill important ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed dispersion, and regulations of vertebrate and invertebrate populations in Neotropical forests and human disturbed habitats. We did an exhaustive literature review, focused on their trophic guild and abundance in disturbed habitat, followed by a series of meta-analyzes. We found that omnivorous, carnivorous, insectivorous and hematophagous bats were sensitive to habitat disturbance, while phytophagous were tolerant. In addition, the type of habitat disturbance and the type of forest where it occurs explain the differences of bat abundance within each trophic guild. These results could focus the conservation efforts of phyllostomid bats and the ecosystem services they provide in both anthropogenic and conserved habitats.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Carballo-Morales et al., 2021 (see Publications)\n\n\n\n\n",
