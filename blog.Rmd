Since I was little, my passion has been learning more about animals and how they interact with their environment. These thoughts made me study biology and focus on ecology and evolution, using bats as models, especially their trophic interaction and how that is related to their evolution and diversification. As a scientist, I know that the quality and quantity of publications are essential to growing in academia. However, I also know that the experiences one has through learning, research, or any other academic activity (e.g., conferences) and the people one meets make a difference if I seek to improve both as a scientist and as a person. Also, some of those experiences are much more fun than the publication process. So, why not remember and document them?!!
